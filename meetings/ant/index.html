<h2>Ant</h2>
Ant
(<a href="http://ant.apache.org/">http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/</a>)
is a build tool written in Java that
eliminates some of the deficiencies of working with the traditional make tool.
Ant is very customizable because of its inherent use of object-oriented design concepts.
Ant build files are defined in XML
(<a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">http://www.w3.org/XML/</a>)
format and are very easy to use.  The build.xml
file defines various tasks to be executed, any of which can have dependencies on
other tasks.  Ant is also very extensible; since each task is a Java class, you
can easily write your own custom tasks and then use them in the build.xml file.

<h3>Example</h3>

Our example source code is Kurt Kirkham's Performance Lab library, which right
now consists of these files:
<ul>
<li><a href="/meetings/ant/PerformanceLab.java">PerformanceLab.java</a></li>
<li><a href="/meetings/ant/StringTest.java">StringTest.java</a></li>
</ul>

We want to compile the files, jar them up and then create JavaDocs for them.
Here are the tasks (each arrow represents a dependency):
<img width="600" height="170" border="0" alt="tasks.gif" src="/meetings/ant/tasks.gif">
<br>
Here is the resulting <a href="/meetings/ant/build.xml">build.xml</a> file that is used by Ant.

<p>
Now, since the build.xml file is in the same directory as the source files, all
we have to type on the command line is <code>ant</code>.  Here are the results:

<pre>
