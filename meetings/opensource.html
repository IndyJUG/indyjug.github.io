                Many of us are excited about working on a Java-based Open
                Source project.  We discussed some ideas for projects at
                the March 7 meeting.  We invite you to submit ideas of
                your own -- please join our discussion forum and submit
                any ideas you may have. <BR><BR>

                After looking at our options, we have decided to settle on the
                Job Queue project.  Download
                the Source and add your improvements!<BR><BR>
