The Indianapolis Java User Group is a group of professionals and 
hobbyists in the Indianapolis, Indiana area who share an interest in 
the Java programming language and related technology.

Many of us work with Java every day at work while others are students 
or professionals who have not yet worked with Java.

The goal of the IndyJUG is to promote the use of the Java language and 
components across all levels of interest in the greater Indianapolis 
area, by serving as a resource for knowledge, experience and career 
opportunities.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate.
