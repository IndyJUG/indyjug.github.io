The IndyJUG is a group of professionals and hobbyists in the Indianapolis area who share an interest in Java technology. Many of us work with Java every day at work while others are students or professionals who have not yet worked with Java.

The goal of the IndyJUG is to promote the use of the Java language and components across all levels of interest in the greater Indianapolis area, by serving as a resource for knowledge, experience and career opportunities.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate.
