<h2>New to Java?</h2>
Thinking in Java is a good place to start, but if you have little programming experience, even TIJ can seem a bit daunting. While not for everyone, some people will really enjoy <a href="http://www.informit.com/library/library.aspx?b=STY_Java2_24hours">Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 in 24 Hours</a> which has been made available for free by the publisher.<br>
<br>
Another good resource for learning Java is <a href="/ThinkingInC-Beta3/">Thinking in C: Foundations for Java &amp; C++</a> (local). Knowing something about C will make you a better Java programmer. This program is designed to teach you C with the thought that you will turn around and tackle Java (or C++).<br>
