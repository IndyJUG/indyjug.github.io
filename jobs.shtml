<h2>Jobs</h2>

Indianapolis is currently experiencing a Java developer shortage.<br>
<br>
If you are looking for java work, it should not be too hard to find it.<br>
<br>
If you are looking for java workers, that may be more of a challenge.<br>
<br>
There are other Java User Groups that are fairly close to Indianapolis that serve their communities as we do.<br>
If you can't find a job here in Indy or you can't find workers, the other groups do have mailing lists as well that can be leveraged.<br>
<br>
It is common to have to sign up to a list before you can post to it.<br>

<br>
If you want to search a little wider than that, you can consult <a href="http://community.java.net/java-user-groups">java.net</a>.<br>
In addition, there are other online communities such as <a href="http://java.meetup.com/">java.meetup.com</a> that may yield interesting things.<br>
