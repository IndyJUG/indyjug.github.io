## About

The Indianapolis Java User Group is a group of professionals and 
hobbyists in the Indianapolis, Indiana area who share an interest in 
the Java programming language and related technology.

Many of us work with Java every day at work while others are students 
or professionals who have not yet worked with Java.

The goal of the IndyJUG is to promote the use of the Java language and 
components across all levels of interest in the greater Indianapolis 
area, by serving as a resource for knowledge, experience and career 
opportunities.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate.

### History

The Indianapolis Java User Group (IndyJUG) was founded in 2001 by 
Mark Steenbarger. Other key participants of the early JUG include 
Nancy Glenn, Frank Morton, Michael Sheward, Mike Slattery, and 
Chris Bonham. The indyjug.net website was established at this time. The
group started in the Castleton area in the North-East of Indianapolis.

In 2002 the IndyJUG started using [Yahoo Groups](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/indyjug/info)
as the primary means of communicating online.

In 2010 Brice Giesbrecht transitioned in as the group organizer. He
update the indyjug.net website and launched the inaugural Robocode 
competition.

Also in 2010 Chris Beesley launched the [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/grp/home?gid=3662644)
group to supplement the Yahoo Group as a communication tool.

In 2012 Michael Dowden began as the Content & Engagement Manager,
helping Brice line up speakers and organize events.

In 2013 Michael took over as the group organizer and launched the [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/r/inbound/0/0/shareimg/http://www.meetup.com/Indianapolis-Java-User-Group/?a=shareimg)
site.

In 2015 Chuck Eastus joined Michael as a co-organizer, helping host
events and organize speakers. A second quarterly meetup was established
in downtown Indianapolis as a lunchtime venue to supplement the 
traditional northside meetup.

The indyjug.net website was redesigned in 2015 and moved to GitHub for
free static file hosting. All members are able to issue pull requests to
propose content changes to the site.
